# StockScraper
Using Yahoo Finance, scrape a stocks closing price and alert user via Slack 

Right now it works with ATVI only. Change that to the ticker you want and change the user alert to a dollar amount that is above the current price of the ticker that you choose.
Right now it works using knock knock to notify you via slack/email/telegram. Knock knock is used for training deep learning so it will notify you with a training start and end with a machine name. I will change this in the future.
